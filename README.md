# Auctionplace_Behavior_Analysis
Uses R to analyze Ebay auction data in order to draw conclusion from seller/buyer behavior.

Analyzes questions such as "which length auction is the most common, which is best for buyers? which is best for seller?"

The data contains multiple items in the data set, but for simplification we take just the "Xbox console" sales.
